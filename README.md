# 🧠 Emotion Detection from Text

This project aims to detect human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear from text inputs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It was developed using Python in Google Colab.

## 📌 Overview

- Built in Google Colab
- Uses NLP preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization)
- Feature extraction with TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Trained using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualizes emotion distribution and prediction results

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Preprocess the text
3. Extract features
4. Train a classification model
5. Predict emotions for new text inputs

## 📁 Files

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Integrate with real-time applications (e.g., chatbots, sentiment dashboards)
- Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT
- Expand emotion classes for more nuanced analysis
